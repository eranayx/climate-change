About

This website provides a brief overview of climate change. Most sources can be
provided upon request.


Notes

1. I cannot tell you why the website hero readjusts itself sometimes when scrolling.

2. I just started learning BEM. The class names could
   definitely be restructured in a more organized way (all the
   effects__caption__xx).

3. The navbar animations and Javascript are all a little clunky. This was my
   first time messing with animations and JavaScript. (ex: the navbar animations
   plays and slides up when on mobile before readjusting itself)

4. I would love if the navbar faded back in when scrolling up instead of simply
   appearing.

5. I tried using container queries, but it seems I had incorrect syntax or
   insufficient browser support.

6. The headers could have been a utility class.

7. I would've liked to add one more font somewhere.
