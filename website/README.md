Notes

1. I just started learning BEM a day before the due date. The class names could
   definitely be restructured in a more organized way (all the
   effects__caption__xx).

2. The navbar animations and Javascript are all a little clunky. This was my
   first time messing with animations and JavaScript. (ex: the navbar animations
   plays and slides up when on mobile before readjusting itself)

3. I would love if the navbar faded back in when scrolling up instead of simply
   appearing.

4. I tried using container queries, but it seems I had incorrect syntax or
   insufficient browser support.

5. The headers could have been a utility class.

6. I would've liked to add one more font somewhere.
